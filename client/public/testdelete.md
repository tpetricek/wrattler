# Testing the Broken Window hypothesis: are less scenic neighbourhoods linked to more crime?
## Crime data
The first dataset we import is the [MPS LSOA Level Crime (historic)](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary) dataset.

```r
 r1 <- data.frame(id = 1, language ="r")
```


```python
 two = pd.DataFrame({"name":["Jim"], "age":[51]})
```
